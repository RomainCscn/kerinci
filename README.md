# Kerinci Kultur website

Website created for [Kerinci Kultur](www.kerincikulture.com), an indonesian organization located in Sumatra.

Created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

## Instructions on build and deployment

The website is automatically redeployed for each push in the master branch of this repository (thanks to Netlify). Use branches to test new features as any modification in master will alter the online website.

Please refer to the [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) for any specific details about it.

To develop, use the following commands:

Install Gatsby

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RomainCscn/kerinci.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Launch the local version and develop

```bash
gatsby develop
```

Push to master when you're done and want to see the online website updated.
